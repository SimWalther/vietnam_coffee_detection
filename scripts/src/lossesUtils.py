    A weighted version of categorical_crossentropy for keras (2.0.6). This lets you apply a weight to unbalanced classes.
    Variables:
        weights: numpy array of shape (C,) where C is the number of classes

    Usage:
        weights = np.array([0.5,2,10]) # Class one at 0.5, class 2 twice the normal weights, class 3 10x.
        loss = weighted_categorical_crossentropy(weights)
        model.compile(loss=loss,optimizer='adam')

    Code taken from Umberto Griffo, at https://github.com/umbertogriffo/focal-loss-keras

    Softmax version of focal loss.
    When there is a skew between different categories/labels in your data set, you can try to apply this function as a
    loss.

      FL = âˆ‘  -alpha * (1 - p_o,c)^gamma * y_o,c * log(p_o,c)
          c=1
      where m = number of classes, c = class and o = observation
    Parameters:
      alpha -- the same as weighing factor in balanced cross entropy. Alpha is used to specify the weight of different
      categories/labels, the size of the array needs to be consistent with the number of classes.
      gamma -- focusing parameter for modulating factor (1-p)
    Default value:
      gamma -- 2.0 as mentioned in the paper
      alpha -- 0.25 as mentioned in the paper
